              I built and shipped a bunch of ML models that actually workedâ€”no cap,they were 92% accurate. Got deep into tweaking stuff with GridSearchCV and made them even better, so that was a big W. Whole thing was remote, super hands-on, and honestly just vibing with making data do cool things...

              Brainstorming fresh features and AI drops for Shop.to... straight fire. Got my hands dirty building no-code, AI-powered biz apps with chill chat interfaces... felt low-key futuristic. Whole experience was remote, super collaborative, and just vibes all around!
